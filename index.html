			<h2><em>How social media influences the ever changing political climate.</em></h2>
			<p>Media has been changing the way people consume news and information about elections for years. In the 1920’s, the radio changed the way ordinary people interacted with politicians, making them more accessible than ever. Roosevelt’s fireside chats made the conversation intimate, and adopting this new medium of communication was one of the first instances of how media could influence peoples political views and opinions. When televisions became a household item in the 1960’s, people were more connected with politicians than ever before. Being able to see candidates speak versus just hearing them made a world of a difference in terms of voting behavior. </p>

			<p>Mass media has been changing the conversation for decades, and with new technologies comes new challenges. Social media has been taking over globally, and we are more consumed than ever. However, social media is still young, making it difficult to fully study. While social media makes news more accessible, and that accessibility leads people to vote, there is no solid evidence of how exactly social media fits into the picture. </p>
			<p>However, politicians are starting to notice how social media helps their platforms, and have been turning to it en masses to connect with their followers. An estimated 9% of media budgets are set aside for social media. More followers means more visibility. Some of the worlds most popular politicians are in turn some of the internets most followed people. Politicians are participating in conversation through these platforms and help to encourage engagement in politics. Social media increases reach, and gets millennials excited about politics. However, the full effects of social media on voting has yet to be determined. </p>
